## Overview
This is a basic social media notifications page with some functionality to toggle the read and unread notifications. Hit me up if you have any suggestions.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page### Links
